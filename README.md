Multi-Objective PSO used to cluster static data

## Clustering Static Data
For this assignment, you have to develop a multi-objective PSO to cluster data, assuming static data. The data clustering problem is a multi-objective problem, with the following two objectives:
* minimize intra-cluster distances, and 
* maximize inter-cluster distances.

Think carefully about:
1. the representation (how a particle will represent the solution) and 
2. the formulation of the objective functions. 

You have to describe and motivate in your report your choice of representation and objective functions. 

Start by assuming that the number of clusters is a priori specified (i.e known). Then, think of an approach in which the PSO can also dynamically determine the optimal number of clusters.
Evaluate the performance of your multi-objective PSO dat aclustering algorithm using appropriate performance measures for multi-objective optimization problems. Make sure that you evaluate the performance over a number of data sets of varying complexity.
