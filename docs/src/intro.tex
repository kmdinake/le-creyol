For this assignment, it was required that we use a Multi Objective PSO (MOPSO) in the application of clustering static data. Given that any clustering technique can be utilized, the application of MOPSO in the clustering process was left open for the student to decide. This brought up several concerns, some of which are, which clustering approach to use, what is a suitable representation for a particle given the clustering approach, and how to measure the performance of the combined concepts. In this paper I will provide background on the problem domain, the algorithms and approaches used in developing my solution. Thereafter, I will discuss my approach to implementing my solution, provide and explain the research results that I obtained, and finally layout my conclusion.
